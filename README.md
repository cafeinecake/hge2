# HGE-2

HGE2 is a cross-platform 2D rendering engine built on top of SDL, OpenGL,
OpenAL, some leftovers of DirectX and so on. Should build on Windows, 
Mac OS X and Linux, possibly Android.

HGE2 conforms to C++-10 or somewhat even to C++-11 standard.

This project is based on HGE 1.8.1 by Haaf at relishgames.com. Also this
project is based on work of Ryan C. Gordon at icculus.org

See README_hge.md for both hge-unix and HGE readmes.
